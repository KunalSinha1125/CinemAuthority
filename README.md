# CinemAuthority
CinemAuthority is a chatbot that gives you movie recommendations!

There are currently four steps I am working on:
1. Designing the recommendation system. (I will be modeling it off of YouTube's Deep Learning algorithm as described here: https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/fa17/cse291-b/reading/p191-covington.pdf)
2. Extracting potential movie titles from user input (using a neural semantic parser)
3. Extracting sentiment from user input (using BERT)
4. Generating more natural-sounding speech (using various NLG techniques as described here: https://nlg-world.github.io/)

Stay tuned for updates!
